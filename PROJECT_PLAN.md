Project Plan: Web Content Scoring System

1. Project Overview

The Web Content Scoring System is an AI-driven tool designed to analyze and score web content based on readability, sentiment, and engagement. 
The system will leverage Generative AI (GPT-based models), Explainable AI (SHAP/LIME), and web scraping techniques to automate the evaluation of online corporate communications.

2. Objectives

Develop an automated scoring model to assess web content quality.

Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced scoring.

Ensure explainability of the scoring model using SHAP/LIME.

Integrate web scraping to collect and preprocess content.

Build a user-friendly interface for content analysis visualization.

3. Key Features

a. Web Scraping & Data Collection

Extract text content from web pages using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and APIs.

Store and preprocess data for NLP-based analysis.

b. AI Scoring Model

Utilize Hugging Face Transformers for content classification and scoring.

Apply sentiment analysis, readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid), and engagement predictors.

c. Explainability & Interpretation

Implement SHAP to highlight features influencing scores.

Generate visual explanations for user insights.

d. Visualization & Reporting

Use Matplotlib/Plotly to create interactive dashboards.

Provide downloadable reports for corporate insights.

4. Technology Stack

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries & Tools: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Hugging Face Transformers, SHAP, LIME, Matplotlib, Plotly, Flask/Streamlit

Data Handling: Pandas, SQL/NoSQL

5. Milestones & Timeline

Week 1: Web Scraping Implementation (Static & Dynamic Sites)

Week 2: NLP Model Development (Readability & Sentiment Analysis)

Week 3: Explainability (SHAP/LIME Integration)

Week 4: Dashboard Development & Final Testing

6. Expected Outcomes

A functional AI-driven content scoring tool.

A GitHub repository with code, documentation, and results.

A working prototype for potential applications in corporate communications benchmarking.

7. Next Steps

Develop a dataset for testing the scoring model.

Set up a GitHub repository for version control and documentation.

Begin implementation of the scraping module.
